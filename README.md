# FileTransfer

1: Transfer Files from Remote system using Browser 

2: Tested on Linux / Win32 (W2k3/Win7)

3: For accessing the Remote machine's File-System through Internet use ngork. (ngork http 4002)

ToDo :

1: Working on an alternative for ngork as http/s is accessible through NAT , but facing issues with web-sockets which are used by SFTP-WS.

2: Clean-up the code.
